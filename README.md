### Quest

The quest is known beforehand and is a bingocard.
The seed of the bingocard is known beforehand:
Its the day of the year in the following format: YYYYMMDD,
On Easy mode.
Here's a link to the bingocard:
https://mcquest.daanschenkel.nl/bingokaart.html (Caution: This will lead to the bingocard of the day you're clicking on it. NOT the day of the next quest!)
The Minecraft seed is the same, so the teams can prepare.
