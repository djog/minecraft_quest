 * Richel

The purpose of a referee is to ensure the game is played fairly.
A referee is invisible, can freely move around and cannot modify the world.

### Moderators

 * Chris, Daan, Rohan, Youri

The purpose of the moderators is to make the server run smoothly
and that the game can be played fairly and with as little as possible.

A moderator is invisible, can freely move around and cannot modify the world.

### Teamcaptain

 * Jonas/Peter/Rijk/Youri: Team Netherlands
 * None (feel encouraged to take up this role!): Team Sweden

The purpose of the teamcaptains is to steer the team in working together.

A team captain is a regular player.

### Servers

### Behavior

 * Behave as a good team member
 * Teams both have half of the world.
 * We don't steal from our team and be respectful to our team members.

   The only clients that are allowed are FPS boosters such as optifine. 
   NO waypoints, minimaps and such.

## FAQ

### What are the settings?

 * Minecraft 1.18.2 (stable)
 * Survival mode
 * Easy mode
 * No command blocks

### Why so short?

Its intentionally so you have to work with your team.

### What is the maximum amount of players?

16.

### I don't have Minecraft

Then you cannot participate

You can still participate! You can join the mcquest server on any bedrock platform.

### Whats the age limit?

From 8 to (and including) 18 years.

### I did something on the bingo card. What do I do?

The Discord bingo cards detect this automatically.
If not, talk to the referee.
He/she'll take a look at your inventory and/or your surroundings.

### Can I use my [resources] after I scored a point with them?

Yes! If, for example, there was an objective to collect 16 carrots,
you can eat those after a referee has seen you did.

### A team member and I **together** have collected enough [resources]. Does that count?

No, the resources must be in the same inventory.

### I have a question

Join the Discord or make an issue on GitHub.

### How does the server work?

We're using multiple plugins made by [Daan and Youri](https://github.com/daanschenkel), 
you can find those in the repository.
